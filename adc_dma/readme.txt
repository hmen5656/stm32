analog to digital converter with dma (direct memory access) it helps us when we are getting some datas from any sensors or any other devices we dont use uC at maintime to read data , datas are handled by DMA module and with this module i'm storing those datas in an array and im using them whenever i want , other wise i I dont use DMA ,i would have to access firstl ADC channel and then make it ready for reading datas then read them ....and morre over. it would take lots of time in main proccess .
with dma we are running kind of RTOS.
